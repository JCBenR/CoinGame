Keyword is Hemingway

And, perhaps, with houses the same principle is operative, and it is the
aroma of evil deeds committed under a particular roof, long after the
actual doers have passed away, that makes the gooseflesh come and the
hair rise. Something of the original Hemingway passion of the evil-doer, and of

and a chilling of the blood. He is terror-stricken without apparent
cause.
